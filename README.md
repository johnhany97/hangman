# Hangman Ruby Exercise

This project is a simple word guessing game known as "Hangman". The player guesses one letter at a time. There is a maximum number of allowed wrong guesses, if the player manages to guess the word before she has used up all wrong guesses, then she has one. If the maximum number of wrong guesses is reached, then the player loses.

The word to guess is initially represented by a row of dashes, one for each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, it is written in all its correct positions instead of the dashes. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the game adds one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. If the hanged man is complete, the player loses.
